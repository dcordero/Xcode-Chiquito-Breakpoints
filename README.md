## How to use

The easiest way to use these sounds is to add them to Xcode's breakpoint editor sound menu:

1. Download the sounds
2. Copy the audio files to `~/Library/Sounds`
3. Quit and relaunch Xcode

## Credits

This project is highly inspired by the work of Alfonso Muñoz-Pomer Fuentes and César Gómez-Mora López who in 1995 released a mod for Doom with the voices of Chiquito.

This project actually uses this same set of sounds, this time for a different purpose.
